# What happend when we do not see the vulnerability ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Why is it not seen 
-- fixed
-- asset offline during scan 
-- segement access ( could not find it)
-- Was not seen ( for some reason )  


# Query Critieria 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Option - "Find the last scan time?"
- Based on the last run, for this asset.
- ScanScope has instances of ScanRun which have vulnerabilities 
- [ScanScope] -> [ScanRun] -> [Vulnerability]


# IP's in a Scan Run

# Logical Security 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- PersonId -> Organization -> Entity 
- Tom wants to go from  PersonId -> Entity
- Dashboard Only shows 1 organization with the option to select multiple sub organizations.
- Abstract this out into an AuthenticationService:IAuthenticationService. 
- This is going to change most likely, which is why the above abstraction is needed. 
- State1 - Login (Security Filter )  
- State2 - Permitted Organization Id's (List<Organiation> ) (SecurityFilter) 

** Implement security, Assets will start out at level 4. 

** see the securityFilter for the implementation. 

# Organization is on Asset 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- We would have to implement a way for a user to select the organization upon logging into the application. 
- SecurityService + Per sonService - Get back the organizations that we need (Spec that out).
- Filter 1 - What they have access too.
- Filter 2 - What the user wants to see ( Concept of Organizaton Selection ) 
- Check for Functions in the database that can assist.
